#LOCO

Loco makes moving easier by ranking a list of prospective homes according to their distances to nearby points of interest.

# Main Features:

1.  Users can save home listing addresses to their ADDRESS BOOK / HOMES
2.  Users can save places of special interest (e.g. work, school) under ADDRESS BOOK / MY PLACES
3.  Users can add and prioritize the features they would like to have in their neighborhood under POINTS OF INTEREST
4.  Users can interact with Google Maps to see their homes and other saved places, and the points of interest that exist around each home listing provided.
5.  Users will see their homes compared against each other within RESULTS and will be able to view the commute details between each home and relevant places around the area.
